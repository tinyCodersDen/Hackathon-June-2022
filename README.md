# Hackathon-June-2022

Hello, this is repository for what I made in a hackathon in June 2022. My project is a volunteering platform, and I called it VolunteerBuddy. Check out the different features and don't forget to explore the different tabs of my project!
## Coding Challenge:
In the Coding Challenge folder, you will find the questions(commented) and the answers to those as solutions.
Version: Python 3.9.6

## Thematic Project:
In this part of the hackathon, you have to make a project in 12 Hours and it has to based off a theme. The theme for this hackathon was "Social Good and Charity". I made a volunteering platform application for this project and feel free to check out the front end and the login system of this project!

### Instructions for running:
First, you will need to install the required modules:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Second, you need to set up the .env file, make sure you create a blank .env file and enter values in the following format:
```make
SENDGRID_API_KEY = '<SENDGRID API_KEY HERE>'
MONGO_PASSWORD = '<MONGODB_KEY HERE>'
SENDER_EMAIL = '<YOUR SENDER_EMAIL HERE>'
RECEIVER_EMAIL = '<YOUR RECEIVER_EMAIL HERE>'
```
Replace the values in the string with your keys and paste it into your .env file.

Once you are done with your API Keys setup, run this commands in your terminal:
```python
python app.py
```
